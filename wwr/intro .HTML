<h1>Hi everyone it is nice to meet you. My name is Alton White</h1>
<p>I was born in Auburn on February 15, 1999. I was raised in a military family. I have moved ten times in my life and have seen all of the US besides Alaska and California. Being an Air Force brat, my experiences have differed from others. I have been forced to mature in some places. I have also missed growth opportunities in other areas.</p>
<p>I would call myself a Sci-Fi and standard Fantasy nerd. I love Marvel and DC Comics. I am enthralled with mythology and psychology.</p>
