        <p class="titles">Main Fork of the Salmon</p>
        <p class="titles">River, Idaho</p>
        <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the
            nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that
            came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
        <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly
            sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy
            beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p>
        <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in
            the United States. As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and
            lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children
            who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

        <p class="titles">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</p>
        <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows
            towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great
            rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
            River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
            historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
        <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>
        <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and
            rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

        <p class="titles">Grand Canyon, Arizona</p>
        <p>This is the granddaddy of all canyons and the granddaddy of all river trips. You will never forget your visit
            to the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly
            unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with
            side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
        <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically
            rated I - X (1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people
            are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>

        <p class="titles">FAQ</p>
        <p>This is a place to answer frequently asked client questions.</p>
        <p>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</p>
        <p>Absolutely, this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found, however, that children over the age
            of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).
            A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a
            time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are
            some of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to
            mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has
            been proven that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which
            are even true!</p>
